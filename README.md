# Introduction

This repository is my personal research notebook.  
It serves as a collection of surface-reconstruction–related papers that I come across anytime and anywhere.

## Paper lists
> This repo. just roughly records the contributions of each paper (Why->What->How). My notes are mainly recorded on Notion.

- __NeuSG: Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting Guidance.__ _Hanlin Chen et.al._ __ArXiv, 2023.__ [[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00846)] [`No Code`] (★★☆☆☆)
  - Scale regularization (the basis of follow-up 3d Gaussian planes).
  - Surface normal alignment of NeuS.

- __SuGaR: Surface-Aligned Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Mesh Reconstruction and High-Quality Mesh Rendering.__ _Antoine Guédon, Vincent Lepetit._ __CVPR, 2024.__ [[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12775)] [[`Code`](https://github.com/Anttwo/SuGaR)] (★★☆☆☆)(No reading code)
  - To reduce interference from overlapping Gaussians, the Gaussian nearest to the point $p$ is selected. \
    The SDF is then defined by shortening the distance along its smallest scale axis, and this estimated SDF is regularized toward the ground-truth SDF to achieve surface alignment.

- __2D Gaussian Splatting for Geometrically Accurate Radiance Fields.__ _Binbin Huang et.al._  __SIGGRAPH, 2024.__ [[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17888)] [[`Code`](https://github.com/hbb1/2d-gaussian-splatting)] (★★★★☆)
  - __Initialize 2D Gaussian primitives__ to ensure multi-view consistency, and use __homogeneous transformations__ to remove the errors introduced by affine projection approximations.

- __High-quality Surface Reconstruction using Gaussian Surfels.__ _Pinxuan Dai, Jiamin Xu et.al._ __SIGGRAPH, 2024.__ [[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17774)] [[`Code`](https://github.com/turandai/gaussian_surfels)] (★★★★☆)
  - Introduces Gaussian surfels (with scale.z = 0) and __adaptively adjusts pixel-wise depths__ when the surfels align with slanted surfaces.

- __Gaussian Opacity Fields: Efficient Adaptive Surface Reconstruction in Unbounded Scenes.__ _Zehao Yu et.al._ __TOG, 2024.__ [[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10772)] [[`Code`](https://github.com/autonomousvision/gaussian-opacity-fields)] (★★★☆☆)

- __PGSR: Planar-based Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and High-Fidelity Surface Reconstruction.__ _Danpeng Chen et.al._ __TVCG, 2024__ [[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06521)] [[`Code`](https://github.com/zju3dv/PGSR)] (★★★☆☆)

- __GS-2M: Gaussian Splatting for Joint Mesh Reconstruction and Material Decomposition.__ _D. M. Nguyen et.al._ __ArXiv, 2025.__ [[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22276)] [[`Code`](https://github.com/ndming/GS-2M/tree/main)] [[`Note`]()] (Unread)
